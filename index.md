## Welcome!

This is a space for me to gather my thoughts and things that Iâ€™ve learned. My hope is that the things I write about will be of value to somebody whether you are an engineer, a student, or somebody not involved in technology at all!

I work in software so a lot of my writing will be covering technology but I also enjoy teaching in my spare time so I will be including pieces to help students in their journeys too.

The majority of my content will be posted over on [dandowney.org](https://www.dandowney.org)
